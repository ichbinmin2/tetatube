        "description": "In theaters and streaming exclusively on @HBOMax* March 26.\n \n*Available on @HBOMax in the US only, for 31 days, at no extra cost to subscribers.\n\nhttps://www.godzillavskong.com/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GodzillaVsKong\nhttps://www.instagram.com/godzillavskong/\nhttps://twitter.com/GodzillaVsKong\n\n---\n\nFrom Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures comes the long-awaited face-off between two icons, “Godzilla vs. Kong,” the next epic adventure in Legendary’s cinematic Monsterverse, directed by Adam Wingard.\n\nLegends collide in “Godzilla vs. Kong” as these mythic adversaries meet in a spectacular battle for the ages, with the fate of the world hanging in the balance.  Kong and his protectors undertake a perilous journey to find his true home, and with them is Jia, a young orphaned girl with whom he has formed a unique and powerful bond.  But they unexpectedly find themselves in the path of an enraged Godzilla, cutting a swath of destruction across the globe.  The epic clash between the two titans—instigated by unseen forces—is only the beginning of the mystery that lies deep within the core of the Earth.\n\nThe film stars Alexander Skarsgård (“Big Little Lies,” “The Little Drummer Girl”), Millie Bobby Brown (“Stranger Things”), Rebecca Hall (“Christine,” “Professor Marston and the Wonder Women”), Brian Tyree Henry (“Joker,” “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse”), Shun Oguri (“Weathering with You”), Eiza González (“Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw”), Julian Dennison (“Deadpool 2”), with Kyle Chandler (“Godzilla: King of the Monsters”) and Demián Bichir (“The Nun,” “The Hateful Eight”).\nWingard (“The Guest,” “You’re Next”) directed from a screenplay by Eric Pearson (“Thor: Ragnarok”) and Max Borenstein (“Godzilla: King of the Monsters,” “Kong: Skull Island”), story by Terry Rossio (“Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales”) and Michael Dougherty & Zach Shields (“Godzilla: King of the Monsters”), based on the character “Godzilla” owned and created by TOHO CO., LTD.  The film was produced by Mary Parent, Alex Garcia, Eric McLeod, Jon Jashni, Thomas Tull and Brian Rogers, with Jay Ashenfelter, Herbert W. Gains, Dan Lin, Roy Lee, Yoshimitsu Banno and Kenji Okuhira executive producing.\n\nThe director’s behind-the-scenes creative team included director of photography Ben Seresin (“The Mummy,” “World War Z”), production designers Owen Paterson (“Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,” “Godzilla”) and Thomas S. Hammock (“Blair Witch”), editor Josh Schaeffer (“Godzilla: King of the Monsters”), costume designer Ann Foley (“Skyscraper”) and visual effects supervisor John “DJ” DesJardin (upcoming “Zack Snyder’s Justice League”).\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures Present a Legendary Pictures Production, A Film By Adam Wingard, “Godzilla vs. Kong.”  The film will be released nationwide in 2D and 3D in select theaters and IMAX on March 26, 2021 and will be available in the U.S. on HBO Max for 31 days from theatrical release.  It is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of creature violence/destruction and brief language.",

Mohamed Salah ends his goalless run with the opener for Liverpool, but Mason Greenwood strikes right back for the visitors. Marcus Rashford gives the hosts the lead in the second half, only for Salah to score again to level the game 10 minutes later. Substitute Bruno Fernandes ends up playing the hero for Man United with his superb free kick past Alisson with 78th minute as the Red Devils advance to the FA Cup fifth round.\n\n✔ Subscribe to ESPN+: http://espnplus.com/soccer/youtube\n✔ Subscribe to ESPN FC on YouTube: http://bit.ly/SUBSCRIBEtoESPNFC",

        "description": "Step inside the pitch meeting that led to Pixar’s Soul!\n\nSubscribe for more Pitch Meetings: http://goo.gl/ho3Hg6\n\nThe people at Pixar are master storytellers, and in recent years have been tackling some increasingly mature themes with movies like Inside Out and Coco. Their latest movie, Soul, starring Jamie Foxx and Tina Fey, tackles the subject of what happens to the soul after we die. These are still kid’s movies, right?\n\nSoul does raise some questions though. Like what kind of injury did Joe sustain when he fell into the manhole? How is his body totally fine when he jumps back into it later? Why aren’t any of the other souls freaking out about their deaths? Is Joe really the first one to freak out and push on the wall a little? What happened to the soul of the doctor he impersonated? Or the cat for that matter? What kind of a message is that ending sending? Why is Marie Antoinette only a floating head? \n\nTo answer all these questions and more, step inside the Pitch Meeting that led to Pixar’s Soul! It’ll be super easy, barely an inconvenience.\n\nCheck Out These Other Amazing Videos:\n\nThe Ultimate Disney Pitch Meeting\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Eydbls2PAE\n\nWonder Woman 1984 Pitch Meeting\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_Tm0SxIp6w\n\n\n\n\nOur Social Media:\nhttps://twitter.com/screenrant\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ScreenRant\n\nOur Website\nhttp://screenrant.com/",

          "description": "Step inside the pitch meeting that led to Pixar’s Soul!\n\nSubscribe for more Pitch Meetings: http://goo.gl/ho3Hg6\n\nThe people at Pixar are master storytellers, and in recent years have been tackling some increasingly mature themes with movies like Inside Out and Coco. Their latest movie, Soul, starring Jamie Foxx and Tina Fey, tackles the subject of what happens to the soul after we die. These are still kid’s movies, right?\n\nSoul does raise some questions though. Like what kind of injury did Joe sustain when he fell into the manhole? How is his body totally fine when he jumps back into it later? Why aren’t any of the other souls freaking out about their deaths? Is Joe really the first one to freak out and push on the wall a little? What happened to the soul of the doctor he impersonated? Or the cat for that matter? What kind of a message is that ending sending? Why is Marie Antoinette only a floating head? \n\nTo answer all these questions and more, step inside the Pitch Meeting that led to Pixar’s Soul! It’ll be super easy, barely an inconvenience.\n\nCheck Out These Other Amazing Videos:\n\nThe Ultimate Disney Pitch Meeting\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Eydbls2PAE\n\nWonder Woman 1984 Pitch Meeting\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_Tm0SxIp6w\n\n\n\n\nOur Social Media:\nhttps://twitter.com/screenrant\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ScreenRant\n\nOur Website\nhttp://screenrant.com/"
